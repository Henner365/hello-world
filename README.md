To allow another person or group to verify and approve merges in a GitHub repository, you can use branch protection rules and required reviews. Here's how you can set it up:

Steps to Enable Merge Verification:
Go to Repository Settings:

Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
Click on the Settings tab.
Set Up Branch Protection Rules:

Under the Code and automation section, click Branches.
In the Branch protection rules section, click Add rule.
Specify the branch you want to protect (e.g., main or master).
Require Pull Request Reviews:

Enable Require a pull request before merging.
Check Require approvals and set the number of required reviewers.
Optionally, enable Require review from Code Owners if you use a CODEOWNERS file to specify who must review changes.
Restrict Who Can Push or Merge:

Enable Restrict who can push to matching branches.
Add specific users, teams, or apps that are allowed to merge.
Save Changes:

Click Save changes to apply the rules.
Optional Enhancements:
Use a CODEOWNERS file to define specific individuals or teams responsible for reviewing changes in certain parts of the codebase.
Enable Status Checks to ensure all tests pass before merging.
This setup ensures that merges are verified and approved by designated reviewers, adding an extra layer of quality control to your repository.
